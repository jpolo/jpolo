# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ”® My vision

I am passionate about open source, web technologies and Lean engineering.

I strongly believe that one developer can achieve productivity through quality. Unfortunately, I have observed in my career that many libraries and tools that I use does not have the quality that I would like.

With my modest contributions, I decided to try to solve developer's every day quality problems by gathering or creating tools and libraries with the highest quality standards.

## ðŸš€ My projects

At the moment, I am working mainly on Typescript libraries and productivity tools (in bash, make or other)
